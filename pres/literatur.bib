  abstract = {Superpixels are becoming increasingly popular for use in  computer vision applications. However, there are few  algorithms that output a desired number of regular, compact  superpixels with a low computational overhead. We introduce  a novel algorithm that clusters pixels in the combined  five-dimensional color and image plane space to efficiently  generate compact, nearly uniform superpixels. The  simplicity of our approach makes it extremely easy to use  -- a lone parameter specifies the number of superpixels --  and the efficiency of the algorithm makes it very  practical. Experiments show that our approach produces  superpixels at a lower computational cost while achieving a  segmentation quality equal to or greater than four  state-of-the-art methods, as measured by boundary recall  and under-segmentation error. We also demonstrate the  benefits of our superpixel approach in contrast to existing  methods for two tasks in which superpixels have already  been shown to increase performance over pixel-based  methods.},

  abstract = {Counting craters is a paramount tool of planetary analysis because it provides relative dating of planetary surfaces. Dating surfaces with high spatial resolution requires counting a very large number of small, sub-kilometer size craters. Exhaustive manual surveys of such craters over extensive regions are impractical, sparking interest in designing crater detection algorithms (CDAs). As a part of our effort to design a CDA, which is robust and practical for planetary research analysis, we propose a crater detection approach that utilizes both shape and texture features to identify efficiently sub-kilometer craters in high resolution panchromatic images. First, a mathematical morphology-based shape analysis is used to identify regions in an image that may contain craters; only those regions – crater candidates – are the subject of further processing. Second, image texture features in combination with the boosting ensemble supervised learning algorithm are used to accurately classify previously identified candidates into craters and non-craters. The design of the proposed CDA is described and its performance is evaluated using a high resolution image of Mars for which sub-kilometer craters have been manually identified. The overall detection rate of the proposed CDA is 81%, the branching factor is 0.14, and the overall quality factor is 72%. This performance is a significant improvement over the previous CDA based exclusively on the shape features. The combination of performance level and computational efficiency offered by this CDA makes it attractive for practical application.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a methodology that brings together a number of techniques in the fields of image processing and pattern recognition with the purpose of achieving the automated detection of impact craters on images of planetary surfaces. The modular approach adopted for its development includes a phase of candidate selection, followed by template matching, in which the probability associated to each detection is established, and finally, by the analysis of the probability volume, in which the identification of craters on the image is achieved. It is tested on a set of images from four different regions of the surface of the planet Mars, all obtained by the same sensor in the last decade. The recognition rates for craters with radii that are larger than five pixels are very good, both globally and for each of the individual areas. The performance of the algorithm in the face of the variation of some of its parameters is analyzed and discussed in detail. We believe that this is a tool that is suitable for a general application in any area of a planet or satellite captured in an image, whatever the geomorphological setting, the optical sensor, and the conditions of illumination are.},

  abstract = {Recently, all the craters from the major currently available manually assembled catalogs have been merged into the catalog with 57 633 known Martian impact craters. This paper presents a new crater detection algorithm (CDA) for the search of still uncataloged impact craters. The CDA is based on fuzzy edge detectors and Radon/Hough transform and utilizes digital topography data instead of image data. The critical parts of the method providing increased accuracy are as follows: (1) gradient-value/orientation-based techniques; (2) automated morphometry measurements of depth/diameter ratio, circularity, topographic cross-profile, rim, central peak, and radial range where the crater is preserved; (3) circularity analysis of votes in parameter space; (4) slip tuning of detected craters' parameters; and (5) calibration which partially compensates differences in morphology between small and large craters. Using the framework for the evaluation of CDAs, in comparison with prior work, the proposed detector shows the following: (1) significantly larger area under the free-response receiver operating characteristics (AUROC) and (2) significantly larger number of correct detections. Using the Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter data as input, the CDA proposed numerous candidates for GT-57633 catalog extension. After the manual survey of all proposed craters and rejection of false detections, 57 592 impact craters were confirmed as correct detections. The accompanying result to the CDA is a new GT-115225 catalog.},

CTX will (1) provide context images for data acquired by other MRO instruments, (2) observe features of interest to NASA's Mars Exploration Program (e.g., candidate landing sites), and (3) conduct a scientific investigation, led by the MARCI team, of geologic, geomorphic, and meteorological processes on Mars. CTX consists of a digital electronics assembly; a 350 mm f/3.25 Schmidt-type telescope of catadioptric optical design with a 5.7° field of view, providing a ∼30-km-wide swath from ∼290 km altitude; and a 5000-element CCD with a band pass of 500–700 nm and 7 μm pixels, giving ∼6 m/pixel spatial resolution from MRO's nearly circular, nearly polar mapping orbit. Raw data are transferred to the MRO spacecraft flight computer for processing (e.g., data compression) before transmission to Earth. The ground data system and operations are based on 9 years of Mars Global Surveyor Mars Orbiter Camera on-orbit experience. CTX has been allocated 12\% of the total MRO data return, or about ≥3 terabits for the nominal mission. This data volume would cover ∼9\% of Mars at 6 m/pixel, but overlapping images (for stereo, mosaics, and observation of changes and meteorological events) will reduce this area. CTX acquired its first (instrument checkout) images of Mars on 24 March 2006.},

Experimental studies for the application are utilized 4 different FCN architectures named FCN-AlexNet, FCN-8s, FCN-16s and FCN-32s. For the experimental studies, FCNs are first trained separately and validation accuracies of these trained network models on the used dataset is compared. In addition, image segmentation inferences are visualized to take account of how precisely FCN architectures can segment objects.},

The channels are characterized by a bank of Gabor filters that nearly uniformly covers the spatial-frequency domain, and a systematic filter selection scheme is proposed, which is based on reconstruction of the input image from the filtered images. Texture features are obtained by subjecting each (selected) filtered image to a nonlinear transformation and computing a measure of “energy” in a window around each pixel. A square-error clustering algorithm is then used to integrate the feature images and produce a segmentation. A simple procedure to incorporate spatial information in the clustering process is proposed. A relative index is used to estimate the “true” number of texture categories."

	abstract="This paper proposes an information theoretic criterion for comparing two partitions, or clusterings, of the same data set. The criterion, called variation of information (VI), measures the amount of information lost and gained in changing from clustering {\$}{\{}{\backslash}cal C{\}}{\$}to clustering {\$}{\{}{\backslash}cal C{\}}'{\$}. The criterion makes no assumptions about how the clusterings were generated and applies to both soft and hard clusterings. The basic properties of VI are presented and discussed from the point of view of comparing clusterings. In particular, the VI is positive, symmetric and obeys the triangle inequality. Thus, surprisingly enough, it is a true metric on the space of clusterings.",

	abstract = {Impact craters have been used as a standard metric for a plethora of planetary applications for many decades, including age-dating, geologic mapping and stratigraphic relationships, as tracers for surface processes, and as locations for sampling lower crust and upper mantle material. Utilizing craters for these and other investigations is significantly aided by a uniform catalog of craters across the surface of interest. Consequently, catalogs of craters have been developed for decades for the Moon and other planets. We present a new global catalog of Martian craters statistically complete to diameters D >=1 km. It contains 384,343 craters, and for each crater it lists detailed positional, interior morphologic, ejecta morphologic and morphometric data, and modification state information if it could be determined. In this paper, we detail how the database was created, the different fields assigned, and statistical uncertainties and checks. In our companion paper (Robbins and Hynek, 2012), we discuss the first broad science applications and results of this work.},
