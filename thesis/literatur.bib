	abstract = {Superpixels are becoming increasingly popular for use in  computer vision applications. However, there are few  algorithms that output a desired number of regular, compact  superpixels with a low computational overhead. We introduce  a novel algorithm that clusters pixels in the combined  five-dimensional color and image plane space to efficiently  generate compact, nearly uniform superpixels. The  simplicity of our approach makes it extremely easy to use  -- a lone parameter specifies the number of superpixels --  and the efficiency of the algorithm makes it very  practical. Experiments show that our approach produces  superpixels at a lower computational cost while achieving a  segmentation quality equal to or greater than four  state-of-the-art methods, as measured by boundary recall  and under-segmentation error. We also demonstrate the  benefits of our superpixel approach in contrast to existing  methods for two tasks in which superpixels have already  been shown to increase performance over pixel-based  methods.},
