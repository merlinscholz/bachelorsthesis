	abstract = {Superpixels are becoming increasingly popular for use in  computer vision applications. However, there are few  algorithms that output a desired number of regular, compact  superpixels with a low computational overhead. We introduce  a novel algorithm that clusters pixels in the combined  five-dimensional color and image plane space to efficiently  generate compact, nearly uniform superpixels. The  simplicity of our approach makes it extremely easy to use  -- a lone parameter specifies the number of superpixels --  and the efficiency of the algorithm makes it very  practical. Experiments show that our approach produces  superpixels at a lower computational cost while achieving a  segmentation quality equal to or greater than four  state-of-the-art methods, as measured by boundary recall  and under-segmentation error. We also demonstrate the  benefits of our superpixel approach in contrast to existing  methods for two tasks in which superpixels have already  been shown to increase performance over pixel-based  methods.},

  abstract = {Counting craters is a paramount tool of planetary analysis because it provides relative dating of planetary surfaces. Dating surfaces with high spatial resolution requires counting a very large number of small, sub-kilometer size craters. Exhaustive manual surveys of such craters over extensive regions are impractical, sparking interest in designing crater detection algorithms (CDAs). As a part of our effort to design a CDA, which is robust and practical for planetary research analysis, we propose a crater detection approach that utilizes both shape and texture features to identify efficiently sub-kilometer craters in high resolution panchromatic images. First, a mathematical morphology-based shape analysis is used to identify regions in an image that may contain craters; only those regions – crater candidates – are the subject of further processing. Second, image texture features in combination with the boosting ensemble supervised learning algorithm are used to accurately classify previously identified candidates into craters and non-craters. The design of the proposed CDA is described and its performance is evaluated using a high resolution image of Mars for which sub-kilometer craters have been manually identified. The overall detection rate of the proposed CDA is 81%, the branching factor is 0.14, and the overall quality factor is 72%. This performance is a significant improvement over the previous CDA based exclusively on the shape features. The combination of performance level and computational efficiency offered by this CDA makes it attractive for practical application.},

	Determine if the instance is a crater or not a crater. 1=Crater, 0=Not Crater
	
	Data Set Information:
	This dataset was generated using HRSC nadir panchromatic image h0905_0000 taken by the Mars Express spacecraft. The images is located in the Xanthe Terra, centered on Nanedi Vallis and covers mostly Noachian terrain on Mars. The image had a resolution of 12.5 meters/pixel.
	
	Data Set Generation:
	
	Using the technique described by L. Bandeira (Bandeira, Ding, Stepinski. 2010.Automatic Detection of Sub-km Craters Using Shape and Texture Information) we identify crater candidates in the image using the pipeline depicted in the figure below. Each crater candidate image block is normalized to a standard scale of 48 pixels. Each of the nine kinds of image masks probes the normalized image block in four different scales of 12 pixels, 24 pixels, 36 pixels, and 48 pixels, with a step of a third of the mask size (meaning 2/3 overlap). We totally extract 1,090 Haar-like attributes using nine types of masks as the attribute vectors to represent each crater candidate.
	The dataset was converted to the Weka ARFF format by Joseph Paul Cohen in 2012.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a methodology that brings together a number of techniques in the fields of image processing and pattern recognition with the purpose of achieving the automated detection of impact craters on images of planetary surfaces. The modular approach adopted for its development includes a phase of candidate selection, followed by template matching, in which the probability associated to each detection is established, and finally, by the analysis of the probability volume, in which the identification of craters on the image is achieved. It is tested on a set of images from four different regions of the surface of the planet Mars, all obtained by the same sensor in the last decade. The recognition rates for craters with radii that are larger than five pixels are very good, both globally and for each of the individual areas. The performance of the algorithm in the face of the variation of some of its parameters is analyzed and discussed in detail. We believe that this is a tool that is suitable for a general application in any area of a planet or satellite captured in an image, whatever the geomorphological setting, the optical sensor, and the conditions of illumination are.},

  abstract = {Recently, all the craters from the major currently available manually assembled catalogs have been merged into the catalog with 57 633 known Martian impact craters. This paper presents a new crater detection algorithm (CDA) for the search of still uncataloged impact craters. The CDA is based on fuzzy edge detectors and Radon/Hough transform and utilizes digital topography data instead of image data. The critical parts of the method providing increased accuracy are as follows: (1) gradient-value/orientation-based techniques; (2) automated morphometry measurements of depth/diameter ratio, circularity, topographic cross-profile, rim, central peak, and radial range where the crater is preserved; (3) circularity analysis of votes in parameter space; (4) slip tuning of detected craters' parameters; and (5) calibration which partially compensates differences in morphology between small and large craters. Using the framework for the evaluation of CDAs, in comparison with prior work, the proposed detector shows the following: (1) significantly larger area under the free-response receiver operating characteristics (AUROC) and (2) significantly larger number of correct detections. Using the Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter data as input, the CDA proposed numerous candidates for GT-57633 catalog extension. After the manual survey of all proposed craters and rejection of false detections, 57 592 impact craters were confirmed as correct detections. The accompanying result to the CDA is a new GT-115225 catalog.},
