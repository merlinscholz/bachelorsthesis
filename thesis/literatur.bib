	abstract = {Superpixels are becoming increasingly popular for use in  computer vision applications. However, there are few  algorithms that output a desired number of regular, compact  superpixels with a low computational overhead. We introduce  a novel algorithm that clusters pixels in the combined  five-dimensional color and image plane space to efficiently  generate compact, nearly uniform superpixels. The  simplicity of our approach makes it extremely easy to use  -- a lone parameter specifies the number of superpixels --  and the efficiency of the algorithm makes it very  practical. Experiments show that our approach produces  superpixels at a lower computational cost while achieving a  segmentation quality equal to or greater than four  state-of-the-art methods, as measured by boundary recall  and under-segmentation error. We also demonstrate the  benefits of our superpixel approach in contrast to existing  methods for two tasks in which superpixels have already  been shown to increase performance over pixel-based  methods.},

	abstract = "Counting craters is a paramount tool of planetary analysis because it provides relative dating of planetary surfaces. Dating surfaces with high spatial resolution requires counting a very large number of small, sub-kilometer size craters. Exhaustive manual surveys of such craters over extensive regions are impractical, sparking interest in designing crater detection algorithms (CDAs). As a part of our effort to design a CDA, which is robust and practical for planetary research analysis, we propose a crater detection approach that utilizes both shape and texture features to identify efficiently sub-kilometer craters in high resolution panchromatic images. First, a mathematical morphology-based shape analysis is used to identify regions in an image that may contain craters; only those regions – crater candidates – are the subject of further processing. Second, image texture features in combination with the boosting ensemble supervised learning algorithm are used to accurately classify previously identified candidates into craters and non-craters. The design of the proposed CDA is described and its performance is evaluated using a high resolution image of Mars for which sub-kilometer craters have been manually identified. The overall detection rate of the proposed CDA is 81%, the branching factor is 0.14, and the overall quality factor is 72%. This performance is a significant improvement over the previous CDA based exclusively on the shape features. The combination of performance level and computational efficiency offered by this CDA makes it attractive for practical application."
