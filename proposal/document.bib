	abstract = {The Context Camera (CTX) on the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) is a Facility Instrument (i.e., government-furnished equipment operated by a science team not responsible for design and fabrication) designed, built, and operated by Malin Space Science Systems and the MRO Mars Color Imager team (MARCI). CTX will (1) provide context images for data acquired by other MRO instruments, (2) observe features of interest to NASA's Mars Exploration Program (e.g., candidate landing sites), and (3) conduct a scientific investigation, led by the MARCI team, of geologic, geomorphic, and meteorological processes on Mars. CTX consists of a digital electronics assembly; a 350 mm f/3.25 Schmidt-type telescope of catadioptric optical design with a 5.7° field of view, providing a ∼30-km-wide swath from ∼290 km altitude; and a 5000-element CCD with a band pass of 500–700 nm and 7 μm pixels, giving ∼6 m/pixel spatial resolution from MRO's nearly circular, nearly polar mapping orbit. Raw data are transferred to the MRO spacecraft flight computer for processing (e.g., data compression) before transmission to Earth. The ground data system and operations are based on 9 years of Mars Global Surveyor Mars Orbiter Camera on-orbit experience. CTX has been allocated 12\% of the total MRO data return, or about ≥3 terabits for the nominal mission. This data volume would cover ∼9\% of Mars at 6 m/pixel, but overlapping images (for stereo, mosaics, and observation of changes and meteorological events) will reduce this area. CTX acquired its first (instrument checkout) images of Mars on 24 March 2006.},

	abstract = {Superpixels are becoming increasingly popular for use in  computer vision applications. However, there are few  algorithms that output a desired number of regular, compact  superpixels with a low computational overhead. We introduce  a novel algorithm that clusters pixels in the combined  five-dimensional color and image plane space to efficiently  generate compact, nearly uniform superpixels. The  simplicity of our approach makes it extremely easy to use  -- a lone parameter specifies the number of superpixels --  and the efficiency of the algorithm makes it very  practical. Experiments show that our approach produces  superpixels at a lower computational cost while achieving a  segmentation quality equal to or greater than four  state-of-the-art methods, as measured by boundary recall  and under-segmentation error. We also demonstrate the  benefits of our superpixel approach in contrast to existing methods for two tasks in which superpixels have already  been shown to increase performance over pixel-based  methods.},

	abstract = 	 {Clustering is central to many data-driven application domains and has been studied extensively in terms of distance functions and grouping algorithms. Relatively little work has focused on learning representations for clustering. In this paper, we propose Deep Embedded Clustering (DEC), a method that simultaneously learns feature representations and cluster assignments using deep neural networks. DEC learns a mapping from the data space to a lower-dimensional feature space in which it iteratively optimizes a clustering objective. Our experimental evaluations on image and text corpora show significant improvement over state-of-the-art methods.}
